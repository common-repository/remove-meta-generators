= 1.1 =
* Modified regex expression for tighter control over meta generator tags as to not spill over to other tags for edge cases.
* Adjusted add_action from `get_header` to `template_redirect` for start of regex to accommodate new WordPress themes that are starting to get away from traditional WordPress theme structure and more javascript focused and not calling header templates in traditional ways via wp_head() i.e. TwentyTwentyFour Theme
* Order of Action hooks for reference https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/hooks/action-reference/
